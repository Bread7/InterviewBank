# Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment Pipeline Security

**CI/CD and Pipeline Security**

A continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is a series of steps that software delivery undergoes from code creation to deployment. Foundational to [DevOps](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-devops), CI/CD streamlines application development through automation of repetitive tasks, which enables early bug detection, reduces manual errors, and accelerates software delivery.

\
There are 4 phases to a Pipeline:\\

1.  **Source Phase**:\
    The source stage involves the version control system where developers commit their code changes. The CI/CD pipeline monitors the repository and triggers the next stage when a new commit is detected. Git, Mercurial, and Subversion are popular version control systems. **(Standard Chartered was migrating from Bitbucket to Azure when i was workin there)**\
    \-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Threats: Source code repositories are prime targets. Malicious modifications can lead to compromised software.
    * Mitigations: Use **signed commits** for traceability. Perform **static code analysis** to detect malicious code.

    Code Example: Signing Commits

`Generate a GPG key`

`gpg --full-generate-key`

`Set GPG signing key in Git`

`git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_GPG_KEY_ID`

`Sign commits by default`

`git config --global commit.gpgsign true`

One of the main functions of the CI/CD pipeline is to test code before deployment to production. This includes security testing, designed to identify vulnerabilities in the code before they are exposed to potential exploitation.\\

2. **Build Phase**:\
   During the build stage, the CI/CD pipeline compiles the source code and creates executable artifacts. The build stage may also involve packaging the code into a Docker container or another format suitable for deployment. The build process should be repeatable and consistent to provide reliability.\
   \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Threats: The build server, if compromised, can be used to inject malicious code into the software.
* Mitigations: Isolate build environments. Regularly scan for vulnerabilities in the build tools and environments.

**Code Example: Secure Build Environment**

`#Dockerfile for building in an isolated environment`

`FROM node:14 AS build WORKDIR /usr/src/app COPY package*.json ./ RUN npm install COPY . . RUN npm run build`\\

Code within a CI/CD pipeline must have access to certain data and resources to build a functioning image for testing. Pipeline access controls limit pipelinesâ€™ access to only what is needed for their roles, minimizing the potential impacts if malicious code is executed within the pipeline.

3. **Automated Testing Phase**:\
   The test phase of the CI/CD pipeline involves running a series of automated tests on the built artifacts. Tests can include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Test automation is crucial at this stage to quickly identify and fix issues.\
   \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Threats: Insufficient testing can miss security flaws, while overly detailed test results can leak sensitive information if exposed.
* Mitigations: Integrate security testing, such as Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), and guard test data.

**Code Example: Dynamic Security Testing in Jenkins**

`pipeline { agent any stages { stage('DAST') { steps { script { sh 'docker run -t owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-baseline.py -t http://your-example-application/' } } } } }`

Applications may require access to various types of confidential information, such as passwords and API keys. As a result, these secrets must be accessible within CI/CD pipelines for testing. If these secrets are exposed in the CI/CD pipeline or DevOps environments, then they may allow an attacker to steal data, access corporate systems, or add malicious functionality to applications.

**PS. What is Jenkins?**\
**It is an open-source automation server, widely used in the realm of software development for its robust capability to facilitate Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). In simpler terms, Jenkins automates the various stages of the software development process, particularly those involving building, testing, and deploying software.**

4. **Deployment Phase**:\
   The deployment stage is the final stage of the CI/CD pipeline. With a continuous delivery setup, the deploy stage prepares the release for manual deployment. In a continuous deployment setup, the pipeline automatically deploys the release to the production environment.\
   \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Threats: Automated deployment tools, if compromised, can deploy malicious updates to production systems.
* Mitigations: Use canary releases and blue/green deployment to detect issues before full deployment.

Since nearly all applications rely upon third-party code to implement various functions. If these third-party libraries contain vulnerabilities or backdoors, this could open applications using the libraries up to exploitation by an attacker.

**PS. What is a Canary Release and what is blue/green deployment?**

A canary release is a strategy where a new version of an application is rolled out to a small subset of users before it is made available to the entire user base. This approach is named after the "canary in a coal mine" concept, where miners used to take a canary with them as an early warning sign for toxic gases.\
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Blue/green deployment** is a method of releasing applications by shifting traffic between two identical environments that only differ in the version of the application they are running.

**How It Works:**

Blue and Green Environments: There are two production environments (Blue - current version, Green - new version).\
\
Deployment: The new version of the application is deployed to the Green environment.\
\
Testing: The Green environment is tested thoroughly. This environment is identical to Blue, ensuring realistic testing conditions.\
\
Switch Over: Once the new version is verified, the traffic is switched from the Blue environment to the Green environment.\
\
Rollback Plan: If anything goes wrong, traffic can be immediately switched back to the Blue environment.

### Best Practices and Securing the CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD pipelines and the applications that they work with face a variety of potential security risks. Some solutions that can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to improve [application security (AppSec)](https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/cloud-security/what-is-application-security-appsec/) include the following:

* Source Composition Analysis (SCA): SCA solutions identify the third-party dependencies that an application uses and the potential vulnerabilities that they contain. This can protect against vulnerable third-party code and supply chain attacks.
* Source Code Scanning: Static application security testing (SAST) examines the source code of an application for potential vulnerabilities. [Code scanning](https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/cloud-security/what-is-code-scanning/) solutions enable DevOps teams to identify and correct vulnerabilities early in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) when they are less expensive to remediate.
* Security Testing: During the testing phase of the SDLC, [dynamic application security testing ](https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/cloud-security/what-is-dynamic-application-security-testing-dast/)(DAST) solutions can identify vulnerabilities in functional applications. These tests occur later in the SDLC but can identify issues that are undetectable by SAST solutions.
* Runtime Security: Vulnerabilities may be overlooked during testing or discovered after an application is in production. Runtime security solutions such as [runtime application self-protection](https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/cloud-security/what-is-runtime-application-self-protection-rasp/) (RASP) can provide ongoing monitoring and protection for an application after it has been deployed to production.

Now that you have a general understanding how Pipeline Systems and Security works. Take a look and answer these questions:

1. "How would you design a CI/CD pipeline to ensure maximum security at each stage?"
2. "Can you describe a situation where a CI/CD pipeline might be vulnerable to a supply chain attack, and how to mitigate it?"
3. "What are some common mistakes teams make in terms of security when setting up their CI/CD pipelines?"
4. "How would you integrate automated security testing into a CI/CD pipeline, and what tools would you use?"
5. "What are the best practices for managing secrets and credentials in CI/CD workflows?"
